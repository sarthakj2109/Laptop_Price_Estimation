# Laptop Price Estimation based on Data Analysis Using Python
Using techniques of data analysis, this project tries to estimate the price of a Laptop based on input parameters such as Storage Size, RAM, Weight, Company, etc. 
Features of this project:
1) Authentic up-to-date dataset of about 300 laptops created and used (Final Updated Laptop Dataset.csv)
2) Data fetched from official company websites and popular E-Commerce websites like amazon and flipkart to provide best discounted price info
3) Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis done efficiently
4) Data Visulaiztion done using numerous graphs like boxplot, scatter plot, count plot, categorical plot, heat maps and relational plots using both matplotlib and seaborn library
5) Analysis of Variance done betwwen different laptop brands
6) ML models developed using Linear Regression algorithm with 92% accuracy and Random Forest Regression with 95% accuracy among others.

Clone the github repo and use the .csv file as the dataset to be imported and the open the Latest BTP.ipynb file in any IDE suitable for data analysis or Machine Learning Applications.
